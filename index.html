                <h3>Q1. Who was Humayun Ahamed?</h3>
                <p>Humayun Ahmed ( [ɦumaijun aɦmed]; 13 November 1948 – 19 July 2012)[4][5] was a Bangladeshi novelist, dramatist, screenwriter, filmmaker, songwriter, scholar, and academic.[6] His breakthrough was his debut novel Nondito Noroke published in 1972.[7] He wrote over 200 fiction and non-fiction books.[8][9] He was one of the most popular authors and filmmakers in post-independence Bangladesh.[10] Dawn referred to him as the cultural legend of Bangladesh.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Q2. How did he become what he was?</h3>
                <p>In the early 1990s, Ahmed emerged as a filmmaker. He went on to make a total of eight films – each based on his novels. Some of his notable films are: Daruchini Dip, Aguner Poroshmoni, Srabon Megher Din, Shonkhonil Karagar, Dui Duari, Shyamol Chhaya and Ghetuputra Komola. He was one of the most influential dramatist in Bangladesh during the 1990s, when he wrote the most popular soap operas. His works, such as Kothao Keu Nei, Aaj Robibar, and Bohubrihi, are still considered masterpieces by fans and critics.[12] Many Bangladeshi filmmakers are still inspired by his works.[13] His films Shyamol Chhaya and Ghetuputra Komola were gradually submitted for the 78th Academy Awards and 85th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category from Bangladesh.[14][15] Later he set up his own production company named Nuhash Chalachitra.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Q3. What was the controversy?</h3>
                <p>On 11 May 2012, two chapters of Ahmed's future novel Deyal were published in the daily Prothom Alo.[53] 3 days later, Attorney General of Bangladesh Mahbubey Alam drew attention of the High Court on a discrepancy about a detail of the historical event of killing Sheikh Russel in Ahmed's writing.[54][53] The court later issued a suo moto rule and asked the authorities to provide Ahmed copies of relevant documents and judgements of the killing case, so that Ahmed could rectify the writing.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Q4. What was his legacy?</h3>
                <p>Exim Bank, a commercial bank and Anyadin, an entertainment magazine jointly introduced an award program, Humayun Ahmed Sahitya Puruskar, which would be conferred to two writers every year on Ahmed's birth anniversary – 12 November.[67]Several cinematographic adaptations of Ahmed's stories are made after his death. Anil Bagchir Ekdin (2015), directed by Morshedul Islam, won six Bangladesh National Film Awards.[68] Krishnopokkho (2016) was directed by Meher Afroz Shaon.[69] In October 2016, she announced the production of her next film based on Nokkhotrer Raat.[70] Debi (2018) is produced by a grant from the Government of Bangladesh.[71][72] </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Q5. What was the reason behind his death?</h3>
                <p>Ahmed had open-heart surgery at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.[61] A few years later, during a routine checkup, doctors found a cancerous tumor in his colon. On 14 September 2011, he was flown to Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York City for treatment.[61] During his stay there, he wrote the novel, Deyal, based on the life of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman after the period of Bangladesh Liberation War.[62] In January 2012, he was appointed as a senior special adviser of the Bangladesh Mission to the United Nations.[63]</p>
